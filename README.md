Time Series Analysis using Genetic Algorithm
Time series prediction plays an important role in many areas It has been traditionally dominated by linear models such as AutoRegressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA). However, it is difficult for these models to deal with non-linear and time varying data.To overcome this difficulty,artificial neural network,Random forest have been deployed. In time series prediction using regression model, the future value is predicted based on the past history of data instances, which is characterized by the input dimension of the Regression model and the time delay between the inputs
Embedding dimension:-Embedding dimension is the number of the past values fed into the network at each time to predict the future value. 
Delay:-The time delay is the delay interval between the adjoining inputs. 
These two parameters determine the structure, the computing complexity and the accuracy of the regression model for time series prediction. The proper selection of the two parameters can reduce the regression model to a parsimonious structure and enhance the modeling accuracy,thus is of great significance. This problem is traditionally addressed using chaotic time series analysis methods. 
The objective of these methods is to find a proper embedding dimension of
the underlying attractor under the assumption of the presence
of long and noise-free data instances. However, for short and
noisy time series data, these methods do not guarantee that the
prediction error for a regression model is minimized.
